# custom-install-scripts
Sadly, not all programs are in Debian/Ubuntu/... repos. That's why I decided to make this repository focused at script for automatic installation of them!
Feel free to correct any mistakes and bugs or to add suggestions or scripts in Issues, or better, make a Pull Request!
If you decide to create a new script, please roughly follow [the template](TEMPLATE).
## Scripts:
- [Ulo≈æ.to downloader](ulozto-downloader) (Czech only)
- [BetterDiscord](betterdiscord)
- [TeamViewer](teamviewer)
- [MS Teams](ms-teams)
